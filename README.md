# todo-list

In this project I'll make a todo list taking in consideraction the OOP principles, in special the single responsability principle.

In this todo list, you'll be able to:
- create / edit / delete categories.
- create / edit / delete todos inside categories.
- set todo priority.
- save and storage your data locally (in your computer).
